# Optimization problem:
# The Pros and Cons of Greedy:
    - Easy to implement
    - Computationally efficient
    - does not always yield the best solution

# Brute force: 
Try all the possible solution until no more possible solution

# Search tree:
The left element means we take it, while the right element we did not take it.
Then we apply recursively to children

* Time is going to be based on the total number of nodes we generate.
* Number of levels is number of items to choose from
* Number of nodes at level i is 2^i
* Make option where we stop traversing when it violates the policy



* Two subclasses of Drunk:
    - The usual drunk, who wanders around at random
    - The masochistic drunk, who tries to move northward.
